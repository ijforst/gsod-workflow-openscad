Lesson Plan 1 (Elementary Grades)
Topic: STL 3C: Various relationships exist between technology and other fields of study.
Grades: 3-5
Lesson Title: Creating Coordinates
Duration: 52- 75 minutes

Overview (include background information):
Students receive a presentation on the history of geometry and then are asked to solve a set of geometric history-related riddles, inputting 
the answers into OpenSCAD to build a specific figure (A word, “Hi!”.) This leads to a discussion about how while geometry was not initially 
created specifically with the intention of being able to construct objects in a 3D modeling software, you can use the things you learned 
related to geometry to build figures.

Lesson Objectives:
Students will be able to identify the impacts that geometry has on the construction of objects.
Students will be able to understand the history of geometry as a discipline. 

Summary of Tasks:
Present on the history of geometry as a field, with an emphasis on geometry’s initial use in surveying, taxing, and other fields, 
as well as current developments in geometry.
Hand out the worksheets to each student or group of students. 
Have the students complete the worksheet.
Have the students model their answers in OpenSCAD. 
Lead a class discussion on what each student learned in the process of creating their OpenSCAD drawings. 

Consumables needed:
A worksheet (attached at the end of this document) for each student or group of students to complete for this assignment.

Teacher Preparations:
Create/find a presentation on the history of geometry (one is linked in the “Additional Resources” section.)
Print a worksheet (attached at the end of this document) for each of the students or groups of students to complete.

Procedures:
Present on the history of geometry. Why was the field of geometry created? What impact does geometry have on different fields? (20-25 minutes.)
Introduce and hand out the worksheet. (2-5 minutes.)
Let the students or groups of students complete the worksheet. (15-20 minutes.) 
Students/groups of students will model their answers in OpenSCAD. (10-15 min)
Discuss: What did you learn about geometry in this worksheet and when creating this figure? What was new information to you? Where do you think 
geometry is now most frequently used in the “real world?” Is that different than where it was used most frequently when it was created? (5-10 minutes.)

Assessment:
Students will correctly complete the worksheet/model the figure and will be an active participant in the post-activity discussion.

History of Geometry Puzzle Game

Let’s build a secret message! Answer the following questions and input the information in parentheses into a new OpenSCAD file to read the hidden message. 
(Correct answers are italicized on the teacher version.)

What was geometry originally created to do?
Explain the movement of the celestial bodies (color("Red") translate([0,0,20]) {sphere(10);})
Give math students something to learn (color("Blue") cylinder(h=100, r1=2, r2=25, center = false);)
*Survey land and construct pyramids* (color("MidnightBlue")translate([0,0,0]) scale([0.5,0.5,2]) cube(10);)

Who first discovered that the circumference of a circle (the distance around the outside of a circle) was 
about 3 times the diameter (the measurement of how wide a circle is)?
Greeks (color("SlateBlue") cylinder(h=8, r1=0.5, r2=22, center = true);)
*Babylonians* (color("MidnightBlue") translate([0,5,7]) scale([0.5,1,0.5]) cube(10);)
Egyptians (color("SpringGreen") rotate_extrude(convexity = 18) translate([12, 0, 2]) circle(r = 4);)

What does the term “geometry” mean?
*Measurement of earth* (color("MidnightBlue") translate([0,15,0]) scale([0.5,0.5,2]) cube(10);)
Numbers philosophy (color ("HotPink") translate([3,20,0]) scale (0.05) sphere(100);)
Learning about the earth (color("Lime") translate ([0,0,0]) scale ([0.1,0.6,0.40]) cube (50);)

What was Euclid’s book called?
Geometry (color("LightBlue") sphere(10);)
The Numbers (color("Chocolate") cylinder (h=10, r1=15, r2=10, center=false);)
*The Elements* (color("DarkRed") translate([0,25,0]) scale([0.5,0.5,1]) cube(10);)

Which culture is famous for its geometric artwork?
*Islamic* (color("DarkRed") translate([0,25,15]) scale([0.5,0.5,0.5]) cube(10);)
Roman (color("MidnightBlue") translate([0,5,7]) scale([0.5,1,0.5]) cube(10);)
Grecian (color("Aquamarine") translate([10,10,10]) scale([0.25,0.25,1]) cube(5);
