Lesson Plan 1 (Lower Elementary Grades)
Topic: STL 2E: People plan in order to get things done.
Grade: K-2
Lesson Title: Creating a Table
Duration: 40-65 minutes

Overview (include background information):
This lesson is designed to teach lower grades students about one of the fundamental concepts of engineering design: the planning phase. 
As a class, students will take a design from an individual drawing to a class-wide solid model using OpenSCAD.

Lesson Objectives:
Students will be able to explain the role that designing and prototyping play in the engineering design process.
Students will be able to discuss why 3D modeling is a useful part of the design process.

Summary of Tasks:
Present on the engineering design process. 
Allow students time to design a table that they like, either individually or as a group.
Discuss as a class: what does their individual table look like? Is it round? Rectangular? How many legs does it have?
Model the most popular elements of the class’ table in OpenSCAD on a projector. If a majority of the class has a table with four legs, model the table with four legs, etc.
Talk about why the class made the decisions that they did when designing their tables.

Consumables needed:
Pieces of graph/printer paper for students to draw their tables on, one (or ½) per student or group of students.
Homework worksheet (provided,) one per student.

Teacher Preparations:
Create/find a presentation on the engineering design process (this is the model for engineering design that ITEEA uses for K-2 students, for more context.)
Get familiar with OpenSCAD in preparation for the live modeling exercise
Gather the graph/printer paper necessary for students to draw their tables
Print enough worksheets so that each student can have one to complete for homework.

Procedures:
Present on the engineering design process. Discuss in detail what steps are involved, what information you need to finish each step, and some 
tools that engineers use for each step in the design process. (20-25 minutes.)

Have students draw what they think of when you say “table” on a piece of paper, either individually or in pairs/small groups. (5-10 minutes.) 

Start a class discussion about the similarities between tables. How many legs did most people say a table had? What shape is the top of the table? 
What color is the table? (5-10 minutes.)

Model the most common features of the table in OpenSCAD. (5-10 min)

Have a debrief discussion. What features did the class’ table have? What would you need besides this design to build a table? 
Would you be able to build a table without having a design? (5-10min)


Assessment:
Students will complete the attached worksheet and explain what they would change about either a chair, a mailbox, or a pencil, and will draw their new design, 
demonstrating the changes they planned to make.
