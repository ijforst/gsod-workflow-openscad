Lesson Plan 1 (Elementary Grades)
Topic: STL 2L: Requirements are the limits to designing or making a product or system.
Grade: 3-5
Lesson Title:Table Requirements
Duration: 45-70 minutes

Overview (include background information):
This lesson is designed to teach elementary grade students about the importance of identifying criteria and 
constraints in the engineering design process. After being given a set of criteria and constraints to design around, students will design a table: 
first by drawing it on a piece of paper, and then by modeling it using OpenSCAD.

Lesson Objectives:
Students will be able to identify the differences between criteria and constraints.
Students will be able to explain why criteria and constraints are included as a part of the engineering design process. 

Summary of Tasks:
Present on the engineering design process, with an emphasis on the identification of criteria and constraints.
Introduce the project to the class, outlining the criteria (things the product must include) and constraints (things the product cannot include) for their table designs.
Have the students, either alone or in groups, draw a table that corresponds to the requirements you outlined in the step above.
Have the students model their tables in OpenSCAD.
Present the files that the students created, and discuss similarities/differences as a class.
Talk about why the class made the decisions that they did when designing their tables.

Consumables needed:
Pieces of graph/printer paper for students to draw their tables on, one (or ½) per student or group of students.
A worksheet (attached at the end of this document) for each student to complete for homework.

Teacher Preparations:
Create/find a presentation on tradeoffs in the engineering design process.
Get familiar with OpenSCAD/create a quick start guide for students to use in preparation for their modeling exercise
Gather the graph/printer paper necessary for students to draw their tables.
Print a worksheet for each student to complete for homework (the worksheets are accessible at the end of the lesson plan.)

Procedures:
Present on criteria and constraints. Why are engineers interested in criteria and constraints? What impact do criteria and constraints have on solving problems? 
What are the differences between criteria and constraints? (20-25 minutes.)

Introduce the table design process. Add two criteria (ie the top of the table must be a circle, the table has to have one or more legs) and two constraints 
(ie the table cannot have four legs, the table cannot be brown) to the design. (5-10 minutes.)

Have students draw a table that corresponds to these criteria and constraints on a piece of paper, either individually or in pairs/small groups. (5-10 minutes.) 
Students will model their table design in OpenSCAD. (10-15 min)

Start a class discussion about the similarities between tables. How many tables look alike? What are the differences? Are the tables “successful?” 
(ie, do they meet all of the criteria, and include none of the constraints?) (5-10 minutes.)

Assessment:
Students will successfully complete the attached worksheet for homework.

Criteria and Constraints Assignment

For each of the following sentences, circle whether the sentence is a criteria (or something that must be included in a design,) or a constraint (something that cannot be included in a design.)

Cars need to have four wheels.              Criteria        Constraint
A chair can’t have more than six legs.      Criteria        Constraint
A pencil needs to have an eraser.           Criteria        Constraint
A computer cannot cost more than $1000.     Criteria        Constraint
A plate needs to hold food.                 Criteria        Constraint
A soda can cannot be closed once it’s open. Criteria        Constraint
Boats need to float.                        Criteria        Constraint
A train needs to have seats.                Criteria        Constraint
A cup cannot have a hole in the bottom.     Criteria        Constraint
School lunch has to be nutritious.          Criteria        Constraint
