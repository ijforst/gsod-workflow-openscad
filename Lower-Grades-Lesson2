Lesson Plan 2 (Lower Elementary Grades)
Topic: STL 3A: The study of technology uses many of the same ideas and skills as other subjects.
Grade: K-2
Lesson Title: Geometric Building Blocks
Duration: 50-85 minutes

Overview (include background information):
Students compare building blocks and pre-drawn OpenSCAD models and are asked to identify similarities/differences. 
This helps students understand both the relationship between geometry, CAD technology, and construction.  

Lesson Objectives:
Students will be able to explain the relationship between technology and basic geometry concepts. 
Students will learn how to describe basic geometric shapes.

Summary of Tasks:
Present on 2D and 3D geometric shapes/terminology that you use to describe them (edges, corners, faces, etc.) 
Give each student or group of students a building block, at random, and have them present their shape to the class. 
Split the class into groups and provide them with the OpenSCAD file. Ask them to identify what shapes they have and explain how their 
shapes are different (different colors, different measurements, etc., based on grade level/ability.) Then, have the students work together 
as a team to build something with the building blocks that they have.
Have each group present their newly built item. Have the class “vote” on which one they like best/model the most popular built item in 
OpenSCAD on a projector.
Talk about the relationship between the built item and the shapes involved. Wrap up with a discussion about how building objects in real life 
is similar to modeling them (i.e how construction is similar to the technology you used:) you need to know how big/what shapes the components are, 
and where those components go.

Consumables needed:
One OpenSCAD file (provided) for each student or group of students.
Homework worksheet (provided,) one per student.
Tape measure or measuring tape, one per group of students. (Optional)

Teacher Preparations:
Prepare for the live modeling demonstration.
Create/find a presentation on basic 2D and 3D geometric shapes.
Download the accompanying OpenSCAD file for student use.
Purchase/find building blocks in each (or some) of the following 3D shapes: cube, cylinder, hemisphere/semisphere (i.e. half or part of a cube,) rectangular prism
Print the provided worksheets: one for each student for homework.   

Procedures:
Present on 2D and 3D geometric shapes, and terminology that you use to describe them (edges, corners, faces, etc.) (15-20 minutes)
Give each student or group of students a building block, at random, and have them present their shape to the class. (What is it called? 
How many edges/faces/corners does it have? etc.) (5-10 minutes.)
Split the class into groups and provide them with the OpenSCAD file. Ask them to identify what shapes they have and explain how their 
shapes are different (different colors, different measurements, etc., based on grade level/ability.) Then, have the students work together as a team to 
build something with the building blocks that they have. (15-20 minutes.)
Have each group present their newly built item. Have the class “vote” on which one they like best. (5-15 minutes.)
Model the most popular built item in OpenSCAD on a projector. (5-10 minutes)
Talk about the relationship between the built item and the shapes involved. Wrap up with a discussion about how building objects in real life is similar 
to modeling them (i.e how construction/geometry is similar to the technology you used today,) you need to know how big/what shapes the components are, 
and where those components go. (5-10 minutes.)

Assessment:
Students will be able to correctly identify the names, as well as the number of faces, edges, and corners of three out of the four shapes on the attached 
homework worksheet.
