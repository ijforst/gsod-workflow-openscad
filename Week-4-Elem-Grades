Lesson Plan 2 (Elementary Grades)
Topic: STL 10C: Troubleshooting is a way of finding out why something does not work so that it can be fixed.
Grades: 3-5
Lesson Title: Solving Bugs
Duration: 50-70 minutes

Overview (include background information):
Students are given a brief overview of troubleshooting, which includes the basic concept and some best practices, 
is before they are given OpenSCAD files with issues in them. Students will troubleshoot the bugs in groups, with 
support from their teachers and classmates. At the
end of class time, the class will discuss what troubleshooting is and what strategies they found most useful when 
they attempted to fix the bug.
Lesson Objectives:
Students will be able to explain what troubleshooting is and the basics of how it works.
Students will be able to understand why troubleshooting is important in the context of the engineering design process.

Summary of Tasks:
Present to students on troubleshooting software files. 
Present the project to students: fixing an OpenSCAD file with errors.  
Have students work in pairs/groups to troubleshoot a file.
Come back together as a class and debrief on why troubleshooting is important to all engineering disciplines, not 
just software engineers when creating and implementing an engineering solution. 

Consumables needed:
N/A

Teacher Preparations:
Create a presentation on troubleshooting to present at the beginning of the lesson.
Download the sample error-ridden file (or, create one of your own!)

Procedures:
Present to students on troubleshooting software files. Include information about what troubleshooting is, how people 
commonly troubleshoot, and best practices to use when troubleshooting. This can be done via a formal presentation, a 
skit, a video, or another presentation medium. (15-20 minutes)
Present the project. Introduce the file, the OpenSCAD documentation, and provide students with a set of general 
suggestions from the presentation on how to approach troubleshooting the problems with the fie. (2-5 minutes.)
Have the students work through the file in pairs or groups. Encourage students to ask questions of their classmates, 
review the OpenSCAD documentation and error messages, and try things within the program to get to the information 
needed to successfully resolve all problems within the file. (30-35 minutes.)
Wrap up with a debrief discussion about the role that troubleshooting plays in all disciples, including engineering, 
life sciences, construction, and other related fields. (5-10 minutes.)

Assessment:
Students will be able to successfully articulate what troubleshooting is and how it works as a part of the following worksheet.

Trouble with Troubleshooting

To demonstrate your understanding of what troubleshooting is and how it works, please complete the following worksheet. 

1. Please describe what troubleshooting means in the context of engineering design. 







2. Explain how you might use troubleshooting if you were creating an engineering solution to a problem. 







3.Have you ever used troubleshooting to solve a problem in your own life? Please explain what the problem was and how/if you solved it.
