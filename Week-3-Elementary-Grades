Lesson Plan 2 (Elementary Grades)
Topic: STL 8D: Requirements for a design include such factors as the desired elements and features of a product or system or the limits that are placed on the design.
Grade: 3-5
Lesson Title: Missing Pieces
Duration: 60-105 minutes

Overview (include background information):
Students are asked to build an object (ie cup, table, etc.) without using one primitive, hopefully getting creative with their design. 
Each student/group presents their solution and discusses the design process.

Lesson Objectives:
Students will be able to identify constraints in the context of an engineering design brief.

Summary of Tasks:
Present on the engineering design process with an emphasis on the identification of criteria and constraints.
Split the class into groups. 
Assign each student or group of students a common household object to design. Within each group of students, give each student a 
different constraint (ie, take away one primitive, their ability to translate certain primitives, etc.)
Have the students create their design based on the parameters provided. If students are split into groups, have each group pick 
one design to present.
Have each group or individual present their designs. 
Discuss why each design looks different, and what design choices each group made.
Finalize the discussion by talking about what constraints exist in the context of real-world designs.

Consumables needed:
One of the worksheets, available at the end of this document, per student.

Teacher Preparations:
Create/find a presentation on the engineering design process (or design as a subject!)
Print one of the worksheets linked at the end of this document for each student.

Procedures:
Present on the engineering design process, with an emphasis on criteria and constraints, and how they guide the design 
process. (15-20 minutes)
Assign students into groups, if desired. Assign each student or group of students a household item to model, giving each 
student a separate constraint. (5-10 minutes.)
Have each student model their household item. (25-30 minutes.)
(Optional) Have each student present their designs to the group. (5-10 minutes.)
Have students (or groups, if applicable) present their designs to the class, noting what their constraint was. (5-10 minutes.)
Have a class discussion about the decisions each student made when designing their objects. (10-15 minutes.)
Wrap up with a discussion about how criteria and constraints play a role in everyday scenarios. (5-10 minutes.)

Assessment:
Students will be able to identify the criteria and constraints outlined in the homework assignment.

Engineering Brief Assignment

Read the following design brief. Underline the criteria and circle the constraints. Write the number of criteria and constraints 
you identified on the lines below. 

A local business, a supermarket (grocery store,) has a problem. Their new products come in boxes of different sizes, making 
it difficult to store them. 

The supermarket is looking for a new way to store the boxes. They only have a $500 budget and have a storeroom that is 
10ft (3m) by 10ft (3m.)

They want you, and your engineering design firm, to create a storage solution for their boxes. Ideally, they would like s
omething that would allow boxes to be sorted by their contents, would be sturdy enough to hold 500lbs, and would be made of recycled material. 

They want you to create the solution over the next three months.


Criteria: __________


Constraints: _________
