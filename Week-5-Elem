Lesson Plan 5 (Elementary Grades)
Topic: STL 12D: Follow step-by-step directions to assemble a product.
Grade: 3-5
Lesson Title: Building the Future
Duration: 50-65 minutes

Overview (include background information):
Students will collaboratively work through an OpenSCAD tutorial and then will have a class discussion about what worked and what did 
not work for them when they used the tutorial.

Lesson Objectives:
Students will be able to understand the role that instructions play in the scientific method/manufacturing process.
Students will be able to use strategies like trial and error and asking questions to find out how something works.

Summary of Tasks:
Present to students about replicability, and its importance in science (for verifying studies) and engineering (for manufacturing) fields.
Split the class into groups, and have each group complete the tutorial and model their brick.
Have a class discussion on why instructions are important in the engineering/scientific processes.

Consumables needed:
N/A

Teacher Preparations:
Create a presentation on the scientific process/engineering design process.

Procedures:
Present to students about replicability/creating instructions, and their importance in science (for verifying studies) and 
engineering (for manufacturing) fields. If you want, you could touch on the role that advances in Computer-Aided Manufacturing (CAM) play in 
manufacturing, touching on topics like G-code (15-20 minutes.)
Split the class into small groups and ask them to follow this OpenSCAD modeling tutorial. (30-35 minutes.)
Wrap up with a debrief discussion about how following instructions has applications beyond class assignments. (5-10 minutes.)

Assessment:
Students will be able to successfully write a set of instructions for one of the scenarios on the following worksheet.

Creating Your Own Instructions

Today in class, we followed a set of step-by-step instructions to model a toy brick. Now, write your own set of instructions below for one of the following scenarios:

Write instructions for how to make your favorite sandwich. Your first step should start with getting the ingredients out of the cabinet/fridge. 
Write a set of instructions for how to feed your pet. Your instructions should include information about what pet you have, how often to 
feed your pet, how much food you feed them, and what you feed them. 
Write instructions for how to get ready for school in the morning. Remember, you need to get out of bed before you can get dressed or brush your teeth!
