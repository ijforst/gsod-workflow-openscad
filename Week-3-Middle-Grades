Lesson Plan 2 (Middle Grades)
Topic: STL 8G: Requirements for a design are made up of criteria and constraints.
Grade: 6-8
Lesson Title: Criteria and Constraints
Duration:60-105 minutes

Overview (include background information):
Students are asked to build an object (ie cup, table, etc.) in pairs, with their partner providng them with criteria and constraints.
Each pair will present their designs and discuss their design process.

Lesson Objectives:
Students will be able to identify criteria and constraints in the context of an engineering design brief.
Students will be able to differentiate between criteria and constraints.

Summary of Tasks:
Present on the engineering design process with an emphasis on the identification of criteria and constraints.
Introduce the modeling assignment. 
Split the class into pairs. 
Within each pair, each student will give the other student a different constraint (ie, take away one 
primitive, their ability to translate certain primitives, etc.) and criteria (ie your design needs to be x units wide, 
or a certain color, etc.)
Have the students create their design based on the parameters provided.
Have each group individual present their designs. 
Discuss why each design looks different, and what design choices each group made.
Finalize the discussion by talking about what criteria and constraints exist in the context of
real-world designs.

Consumables needed:
One of the worksheets, available at the end of this document, per student.

Teacher Preparations:
Create/find a presentation on the engineering design process (or design as a subject!)
Print one of the worksheets linked at the end of this document for each student.

Procedures:
Present on the engineering design process, with an emphasis on criteria and constraints, and 
how they guide the design process. (15-20 minutes)
Assign students into pairs. Assign each pair one common household item to model. (5-10 minutes.)
Have each student in the pair give the other one criteria and one constraint. (5-10 minutes.)
Have each student model their household item. (25-30 minutes.)
Have pairs present their designs to the class, noting what their criteria and constraint was. (5-10 minutes.)
Have a class discussion about the decisions each student made when designing their objects. (10-15 minutes.)
Wrap up with a discussion about how criteria and constraints play a role in everyday design 
and engineering scenarios. (5-10 minutes.)

Assessment:
Students will be able to articulate relevant criteria and constraints in the context of the homework assignment.

Engineering Criteria Assignment

Based on the following scenario, write a series of criteria and constraints that you think would help produce the best 
solution to the following problem. 

A local business, a supermarket (grocery store,) has a problem. Their new products come in boxes of different sizes, making them difficult to store. 

They want you, and your engineering design firm, to create a storage solution for their boxes over the next three months.
