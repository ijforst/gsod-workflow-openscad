Lesson Plan 5 (Middle Grades)
Topic: STL 12H: Use information provided in manuals, protocols, or by experienced people to see and understand how things work.
Grade: 6-8
Lesson Title: Tutorial Trouble
Duration: 65-90 minutes

Overview (include background information):
Students will create an OpenSCAD tutorial for building an object of their choice, relying on existing 
documentation/conversations with their teacher(s) to create complete, useful instructions. 

Lesson Objectives:
Students will be able to understand the importance of documentation in an engineering context.
Students will be able to use strategies like trial and error and asking questions to find out how something works.
Students will be able to communicate the information gathered by asking questions, either verbally or in writing.

Summary of Tasks:
Present to students about documentation in the context of engineering/product design, and why having good 
documentation is important for metrics like customer adoption, safety, and accuracy.
Split the class into groups, and have each group complete the tutorial and model their brick.
Have a class discussion on why instructions are important in the engineering/scientific processes.

Consumables needed:
N/A

Teacher Preparations:
Create or find a presentation on the role that documentation plays in engineering/design fields.

Procedures:
Present to students about documentation in the context of engineering/product design, and why having good documentation 
is important for metrics like customer adoption, safety, and accuracy. (10-15 minutes)
Split the class into small groups of 2-4 students, and have the students pick the item that they want to write OpenSCAD 
modeling instructions (5-10 minutes.)
Have the student groups model their objects and then write a set of instructions to teach someone how to model their item 
(30-35 minutes.)
Pair up each student group with one other group of students - have them try each other’s instructions and write notes about 
what worked and what didn’t (15-20 minutes.)
Wrap up with a debrief discussion about why instructions are important for understanding an item. Also, if there is additional
time, have students share what worked and what didn’t about their group or their partnered group’s instructions. (5-10 minutes.)

Assessment:
Students will be able to successfully write a set of useful, complete instructions for one of the scenarios on the following worksheet.

Build Your Own Instructions

Today in class, you created a set of step-by-step instructions used to model an object. Now, write your own set of individual 
instructions below for one of the following scenarios:

Write instructions for how to make a grilled cheese sandwich/cheese toastie.
Write a set of instructions for how to feed your pet.
Write instructions for how to get ready for school in the morning.
Write a set of instructions for how to cook your favorite dinner.
