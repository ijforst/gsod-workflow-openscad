Lesson Plan 5 (Lower Elementary Grades)
Topic: STL 12A: Discover how things work.
Grade: K-2
Lesson Title: Discovery
Duration: 50-65 minutes

Overview (include background information):
Students will be taught a tutorial on OpenSCAD. Teachers will encourage questions, and at the end of the lesson, 
there will be a group discussion about what ‘discovery’ looks like and what strategies they used to learn to use the program.
Lesson Objectives:
Students will be able to understand the role that asking questions plays in the engineering design process.
Students will be able to use strategies like trial and error and asking questions to find out how something works.

Summary of Tasks:
Present to students about the scientific discovery process, including the historical context around some discoveries 
(i.e Mendelian genetics, the shape of DNA, etc.)
Preform a life coding exercise with OpenSCAD, led by the students asking questions/trying things, to create something 
common/known by the students (a household item, the school mascot, a word, etc.)
Debrief on why asking questions is important for finding out how things work.

Consumables needed: N/A

Teacher Preparations: Create or find a presentation on scientific discovery.

Procedures:
Present on the history and current developments in the scientific discovery process. 
This seven-minute video, featuring Mythbusters star Adam Savage, is a great starting point! (15-20 minutes)
Introduce and then conduct the live coding exercise (creating a common item in OpenSCAD.) 
Encourage students to ask questions and suggest things to try within the program to get to the information 
needed to successfully build the common item. (30-35 minutes.)
Wrap up with a debrief discussion about how asking questions is an important part of discovering the way 
things work. (5-10 minutes.)

Assessment:
Students will be able to successfully complete the following worksheet explaining different strategies they used to 
discover how OpenSCAD works.

Discovery - OpenSCAD

Thanks for helping us build a new thing in class today! What were some of the things that we did to discover how the program worked?

Ask Questions (What were some of the good questions your classmates asked today?


Try new things (What was one thing that we tried, but didn’t work?)


Get guidance from professionals (What is one thing that the teacher suggested that we try?)
