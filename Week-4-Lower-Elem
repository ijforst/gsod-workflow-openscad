Lesson Plan 2 (Lower Elementary Grades)
Topic:STL 10A: Asking questions and making observations helps a person to figure out how things work.
Grade: K-2
Lesson Title: Asking Questions
Duration: 50-70 minutes

Overview (include background information):
Students are tasked with creating an introduction to OpenSCAD for a new student in their class. 
To gather the information, all they can do is use the program on their own/as a class and ask questions. 
The class gets to ask as many questions as they can while filling out the fill-in-the-blank instructional outline.
Lesson Objectives:
Students will be able to understand the role that information-gathering plays in the engineering design process. 
Students will be able to understand how to create useful questions for the “ask” and “learn more” sections of the engineering design process. 

Summary of Tasks:
Present to students about the engineering design process, focusing on the “ask” and “imagine” steps. 
This can be done via a formal presentation, a skit, a video, or another presentation medium. 
Talk about the design brief to students. 
Either have students work individually/in groups to fill out the worksheet or work together as a class to fill out all blanks in the worksheet.
Come back together as a class (if needed) and debrief on why asking questions in the context of this engineering design process was so important. 

Consumables needed:
One “written instructions” worksheet per student.

Teacher Preparations:
Create a presentation of some sort on the engineering design process to present at the beginning of the lesson.
Print out the following worksheet used to describe OpenSCAD, one copy per student, for use in the demonstration. 

Procedures:
Present on the engineering design process’ “state the problem” and “look for ideas” steps (or your design processes’ equivalent.) 
This is the model for engineering design that ITEEA uses for K-2 students, for more context. (15-20 minutes)
Present the design brief. (2-5 minutes.)
“Say we have a new student in our [class name] class. How will you teach them how to use a new computer program, like OpenSCAD?” 
(pause for class suggestions.) “Some engineers teach people how to use their solutions using written instructions. 
Let’s work together to create a set of written instructions so that our new classmate can learn how to use OpenSCAD.” 
Have the students work through the worksheet, either as a class or in groups. Encourage students to ask questions and 
try things within the program to get to the information needed to successfully complete the instructions sheet. (30-35 minutes.)
Wrap up with a debrief discussion about how asking questions is a critical part of the engineering design process that engineers use. 
Include examples from multiple different disciplines (ie requirements gathering in software engineering, etc.) if possible. (5-10 minutes.)

Assessment:
Students will be able to successfully complete the following worksheet detailing one way to create an OpenSCAD file.

Creating an OpenSCAD File

Say we have a new student in our class. How will you teach them how to use a new computer program, like OpenSCAD? 
Some engineers teach people how to use their solutions using written instructions. Let’s work together to create a set of written instructions 
so that our new classmate can learn how to use OpenSCAD.

How do I create a new file?
To create a new OpenSCAD file, ___________ on the OpenSCAD icon either on your ____________ or by searching for OpenSCAD on your computer. 
When the box pops up, click the ____________ button. 

How do I save a file?   
To save an OpenSCAD file, _______________ on the _______ option at the top of the screen. Scroll down to the ___________ button. 
When the prompt pops up on your screen, give your file a _____ by typing it into the “______” box. Click the  _____ button to save your file!
