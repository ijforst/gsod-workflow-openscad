Lesson Plan 1 (Elementary Grades)
Topic: STL 3E: A product, system, or environment developed for one setting may be applied to another setting.
Grades: 6-8
Lesson Title: Creating Coordinates
Duration: 42-60 minutes

Overview (include background information):
Students receive a brief presentation on the history and applications of geometry and then are asked to 
solve a set of geometric history-related riddles, inputting the answers into OpenSCAD to build a specific 
“trophy” figure. This assignment leads to a discussion about the relationships between geometry, technology, 
and construction.

Lesson Objectives:
Students will be able to identify the impacts that geometry has on the construction of objects and on 3D 
modeling software.
Students will be able to describe a 3D object verbally/in written form using appropriate vocabulary.

Summary of Tasks:
Present on the history of geometry as a field, with an emphasis on geometry’s initial use in surveying, taxing, and other 
fields, as well as current developments in geometry.
Hand out the worksheets to each student or group of students. 
Have the students complete the worksheet and model their answers in OpenSCAD. 
Lead a class discussion on what each student learned in the process of creating their OpenSCAD drawings. 

Consumables needed:
A worksheet (attached at the end of this document) for each student or group of students to complete for this assignment.

Teacher Preparations:
Create/find a presentation on the history of geometry/basic geometric vocabulary/what we use geometry for now 
(a supplementary textbook chapter/website with more resources is linked in the “Additional Resources” section.)
Print a worksheet (attached at the end of this document) for each of the students or groups of students to complete.

Procedures:
Present on geometry/vocabulary for talking about geometry. What can you do with geometry? How do you describe different shapes? 
How do we use geometry in our everyday lives? (20-25 minutes.)
Introduce and hand out the worksheet. (2-5 minutes.)
Let the students or groups of students complete the worksheet, modeling their answers in OpenSCAD as they go. (15-20 minutes.) 
Discuss: What did you learn about geometry in this worksheet and when creating this figure? What was new information to you? 
Where do you think geometry is now most frequently used in the “real world?” Is that different than where it was used most frequently 
when it was initially discovered? Do you know how to describe 3D objects now? (5-10 minutes.)

Assessment:
Students will complete the worksheet/model the figure and will be an active participant in the post-activity discussion.

Geometry and Solid Modeling Vocabulary Game

Build yourself a trophy in OpenSCAD by correctly answering the following questions! 
Answer the following questions and follow the instructions that are in parentheses to successfully build the trophy. 

Euclid is considered to be the father of geometry.                 True/False 
(If you answered true, type 18 into the convexity= function in block one. 
If false, leave it at  0.)

What is the smallest number of faces a pyramid can have?          __________
(Type your answer into the circle( r=) function in block one.)

In Euclidian geometry, we find the height, width, and 
volume of objects.                                                  True/False   
(If you answered true, type h = 0 into the cylinder function in block two. 
If you answered false, type h = 8.)

Geometry comes from the Greek words for “earth” and “to study.”      True/False 
(Type your answer into the center= function in block two.)

How many edges does a cube have?                                     __________ 
(Input your answer into the r1 value of block three.)

People set prices of houses based on their perimeter.                True/False
(Type your answer into the center= function in block three.)

A can that you store food in, is an example of a cylinder.           True/False
(Type your answer into the center= function in block four.)

A sphere has how many edges?                                          __________
(Type your answer into the first spot of the translate() function in block four.)

Geometry helps us find how much space is in 3D objects.             True/False
(if you answered true, type 30 in the last value of translate() function in block five. 
If you answered false, type 25 into the last value of translate() in block five.)

 An edge is where two faces meet.                                    True/False
(If you answered true, type 25 into the sphere() command in block five. 
If you answered false, type 30 into the sphere() command in block five.)
