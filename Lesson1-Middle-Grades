Lesson Plan 1 (Middle Grades)
Topic: STL 2S: Trade-off is a decision process recognizing the need for careful compromises among competing factors.
Grades: 6-8
Lesson Title: Building Tables
Duration: 45-70 minutes


Overview (include background information):
This lesson is designed to teach middle-grade students about the importance of trade-offs present in the engineering design process. 
After being given a problem statement to design around (design a table in a specific context,) students will design a table in groups: 
first by drawing it on a piece of paper, and then by modeling it using OpenSCAD.

Lesson Objectives:
Students will be able to identify what tradeoffs in the context of engineering design are, why they are important, 
and the impacts they have on the engineering design process. 

Summary of Tasks:
Present on the engineering design process, specifically on the importance of tradeoffs.
Split the class into four groups, and assign each group a scenario that they would need to design a table for. 
(Dining table in a small dining room, table for a restaurant, teacher’s desk, table in a kindergarten environment.)
Have the students, as a group, draw a table on paper that corresponds to the scenario you outlined in the step above. 
Have the students model their tables in OpenSCAD.
Present the files that each of the groups created, and discuss their designs: why did they make the choices that they did?

Consumables needed:
Four pieces of paper, one for each of the groups. 
A worksheet (attached at the end of this document) for each student to complete for homework.

Teacher Preparations:
Create/find a presentation on the use of tradeoffs in the engineering design process.
Create a quick start guide for students to use in preparation for their modeling exercise in OpenSCAD.
Gather the four pieces of graph/printer paper necessary for the groups to draw their tables.
Print a worksheet (attached at the end of this document) for each of the students. 

Procedures:
Present on trade-offs. Why do engineers have to make trade-offs? 
What impact do different trade-offs have on solving problems? (20-25 minutes.)

Split the class into four groups, and introduce the design projects. 
The design project briefs are as follows: (5-10 minutes.)
    You are a family with five members that has a 10ft by 10ft (3m x 3m) dining room. 
      Design a dining table that will comfortably seat six people, and will fit in the dining room.
    You own a fast-food restaurant that primarily caters to families. You are looking for a table that will accommodate up to four people. 
      Young children (ages 5-12) must be able to comfortably sit at the table. 
    You will redesign a teacher’s desk. The desk must have plenty of storage space, be able to be used by two people (a student on one side and the teacher on the other,) 
      and must be smaller than 3ft by 3ft. (0.9m x 0.9m.)
    You are a kindergarten teacher looking for a new desk that will be at a good height for your students, 
      will be sturdy enough to stand up to years of wear, and will not be likely to cause injuries to students (i.e., rounded corners on the tabletops.)

Have the groups draw a table that corresponds to these criteria and constraints on a piece of paper. (5-10 minutes.) 

The groups will model their table design in OpenSCAD. (10-15 min)

Present the OpenSCAD files and start a class discussion about each of the tables. What do these tables look like? What decisions did each group have to make, 
and why did they make these decisions? Are the tables “successful?” (ie, do they meet all of the criteria in the design briefs, if applicable?) (5-10 minutes.)

Assessment:
Students will successfully complete the attached worksheet for homework.

Engineering Trade-Offs Assignment

Your local park has asked you to create a new picnic bench design. Here are the criteria and constraints:
It must be made out of wood.
It must be wheelchair accessible.
It cannot be likely to cause injuries.

Draw your design in the space provided. For each of the decisions you made (material, shape of the tabletop, etc.) explain why you chose to design it that way.
